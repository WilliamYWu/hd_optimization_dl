    "Welcome to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* is an open-source programming language\n",
    "* is very popular for general-purpose programming\n",
    "    - Highly readable syntax, often reading like regular english\n",
    "* has a huge open source community, providing tools to perform almost any task\n",
    "* tends to be faster than R, but it is still an interpreted language. Compiled languages like C, Go, Rust, etc. will all generally perform faster than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't one single \"RStudio\" IDE that is the go-to for writing python. There are 3 standout options at the Board:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spyder, the Board has Spyder installed on SALT\n",
    "    - Versions Spyder Py3 and Spyder4 Py4, running python 3.7.7 and 3.8.8. respectively (but this rarely matters).\n",
    "    - Spyder5 runs the latest version of Python\n",
    "    - These are most similar to Rstudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter notebook\n",
    "   - The environment used to create this! Very similiar to R Markdown, allowing for markdown to help explain your code as you go.\n",
    "         * Able to run chunks of code, potentially in any order.\n",
    "         * File is named `.ipynb` from `.py` (analogous to `.R` -> `.Rmd`, between R and R Markdown).\n",
    "         * Can be exported to html for embedding in other web products.\n",
    "         * To open, call `jupyter3 notebook` or `jupyter3 lab` in the linux console inside the directory what you want to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* VS Code\n",
    "    - Available both on Linux and Windows\n",
    "    - Is a text editor which means that you can open most scripts in it such as `.inp` files\n",
    "        - Also means that as long as you install the right extension and interpreter you can write in almost any language in it.\n",
    "    - A lot of customizability and easy to install extensions\n",
    "    - Capable of working with `.py` and `ipynb` scripts\n",
    "    - Can work in the browser https://vscode.dev/ (not recommended)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Helpful Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ctrl + enter`: runs the code in the current cell\n",
    "* `shift + enter`: runs the code in the current cell and jumps to the cell below it or creates a new cell below it if there is not yet a cell below\n",
    "* `esc -> b`: creates a new cell below the current cell (b for below)\n",
    "* `esc -> a`: creates a new cell above the current cell (a for above)\n",
    "* `esc -> dd`: deletes the current cell\n",
    "* `esc -> h`: opens a list of many jupyter notebook shortcuts"

    "A common pattern you may see is, rather than accessing an element with `d[\"key\"]`, you will see it accessed as `d.get(\"key\", some_default_value)`. The `.get` method works the same way as accessing an item with `d[\"key\"]`, but returns a specified default value if the item doesn't exist. Usually, this is `None`, but other defaults can be useful, for example, in applications where you need to translate specific mnemonics between data sources."

    "Functions are the same in Python as they are in other languages. That is, they are reusable bits of code that take input(s), operate on them, and `return` an output. Think of a function in math: $f(x) = x^2$ is a function named $f$ that takes an input $x$ and returns an output $x^2$. Similar to math, a function can have multiple inputs (and even return multiple things, though we won't cover that here). We often call inputs **arguments** to that function, or `args` for short.\n",

    "The distinction between a **function** and a **method** is simple: a **method** is attached to a specific **data type**, often called with `object_name.method(input1, input2, ...)`.

We won't cover how to create your own types with attached methods, but understanding the distinction between functions and methods is important to understanding how Python works.\n",
